<p>The results of tests, such as personality or team dynamics assessments, can provide valuable insights into an individual's strengths, preferences, and tendencies in a team setting. Understanding these characteristics helps me to know how I interact with others in a team and what roles or responsibilities I am well-suited for.</p>

<p>In terms of influencing behaviour, the results of these tests can be a helpful tool for self-reflection and understanding how to best contribute to a team. For example, suppose the results show that an individual tends to be more introverted and analytical. In that case, I may need to try to actively participate in team discussions and meetings rather than relying on others to speak up on their behalf.</p>

<p>When forming a team, it can be helpful to consider the results of these tests as one factor among many in selecting team members. However, it is essential to consider other relevant factors, such as skills, experience, and overall fit with the team and the project. It can be helpful to have a diverse range of personalities and abilities within a group, as this can lead to a more well-rounded and dynamic team. However, it is also vital to ensure that team members can work effectively together and support each other towards common goals.</p>
<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Sustainable agriculture is essential to providing nutritious food for human consumption. It's crucial to protect humans living on earth. Humans have been using more and more natural resources. Suppose we lose significant portions of this biological diversity world. In that case, the quality of life of humans will reduce, and our future generations will be at high risk unless effective action is taken. This project is about helping farmers increase agricultural productivity using automation processes. The system monitors the plant's soil nutrition and moisture level according to current weather conditions and controls water and fertilizer. Moreover, farmers can view real-time data.</p>
<p>Motivation </p>
<p>I live on the northwest coast of Tasmania. It's famous for its rich fertile soil perfect medium for carrots, cabbages and cauliflowers. When I spoke to a few Tasmanian farmers, they told me they are struggling with the low labour shortage. Last month, Australia suffered flash floods in southeast Melbourne suburbs, damaging many farms. Also, the latest UN projections suggest that the global population will reach about ten billion by 2050, so it is becoming an increasingly essential food. That terrible news motivates me to build project ideas that help farmers to introduce modern technology to their farms to gain maximum results with low labour costs.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>Intelligent agriculture involves the use of various technological improvements in physical farming operations. The Internet of Things and cloud computing technologies contribute to this evolution by introducing more robots and artificial intelligence into agriculture.</p>
<p>One of the significant challenges facing society today is the limited availability of water for human consumption. Agriculture is an important consumer of water. Therefore, it is essential to implement efficient water use systems in order to conserve this valuable resource. So, in this project, I have used a soil moisture sensor; it estimates the amount of moisture around plants, and if the soil moisture level drops below a set value, it sends a signal to the system and then turns on the water pump. It maintains the soil moisture around the plant. This irrigation system provides water when needed while reducing excess water consumption. This system has two different modes manual mode and automatic mode. So, farmers can turn them on and off manually when necessary. All this system can entirely control using an application we develop using flutter.</p>
<p>We should reduce using fertilizer because the over-fertilizer runs into the environment and fertilizes the rivers and lakes, unbalancing the ecosystems and causing biodiversity loss. Another primary purpose of this project idea is to reduce farmers' manual operation of applying fertilizer on the farm, which has the following advantages: speedy, low labour cost and more profitable. Also, the intelligent irrigation system can improve plant growth rates and increase crop yields at Harvest by providing the right amount of liquid fertilizer at the appropriate time. This helps to save on fertilizer costs and resources, leading to more efficient and effective farming practices. The irrigation system uses an NPK sensor to detect the nutrient levels in the soil. Irrigation only occurs when the soil nutrition falls below a certain threshold, and the water pump is turned on or off based on this threshold value, saving farmers time and resources. The mechanism is the same as the soil moisture system. We use a Temperature sensor on this to help monitor humidity and temperature around the farm to get maximum results.</p>
<p>In smart agriculture, access to accurate and up-to-date information is vital for understanding the growth and conditions of a farm, which can help to make better decisions, reduce waste, and enhance production efficiency. With the sensors and technology, we use in this project, Real-time data systematically drive the procedure of farming processes. Farmers can access real-time data via mobile applications or webpage. All these sensors will be connected strategically, representing a sector of the Harvest, thus constructing various zones to facilitate their study and observation. The farmer can view the data remotely and review it afterwards simultaneously. So, information about his work is in the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>There are several features on the application. The application lets users view real-time data on various environmental and atmospheric factors, including air temperature, humidity, soil nutrition, water tank level, and fertilizer tank level. The two tanks include water and fertilizer in the system, and Both tank water levels can monitor from the application. If it is low, automatically send a notification to the farmer. So, it saves a lot of time and stress.</p>
<p>Tools and Technologies </p>
<p>The following software and hardware are required for this project.</p>
<p>•	Arduino control panel: The Arduino control panel is a device that can manage and monitor various parts, such as sensors and other parts, through digital and analogue inputs. It can also be connected to additional boards to expand its capabilities.</p>
<p>•	ESP32 board:  this board used for uploading real-time data to firebase</p>
<p>•	Ultrasonic distance sensor:  it helps to monitor tanks capacity</p>
<p>•	NPK sensor:  detecting the soil's nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content.</p>
<p>•	Moisture sensor: detecting the soil’s moisture level</p>
<p>•	Temperature sensor; detecting the temperature </p>
<p>•	Arduino Integrated Development Environment: programming the Arduino board </p>
<p>•	Flutter: to develop the web and mobile application</p>
<p>•	Firebase: used as a cloud platform
</p>
<p>Skills Required </p>
<p>Programming skills need to write software to control the system and manage data processing. This skill requires knowledge of programming languages such as Python, C++, or Java.</p>
<p>Electronics and Hardware skills need to select and integrate sensors, actuators, and controllers to build the system's hardware components. This skill requires knowledge of electronics, microcontrollers, and other related technologies.</p>
<p>Data analysis and machine learning skills need to use data analysis and machine learning techniques to optimize irrigation and fertilization decisions. This skill may require knowledge of tools and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and sci-kit-learn.</p>
<p>Agriculture and plant physiology to build a system that effectively supports crop growth, you must have a solid understanding of the factors that affect plant growth and how to optimize them. This skill requires knowledge of soil science, plant nutrition, and other related fields.</p>
<p>Outcome</p>
<p>This intelligent watering system uses IoT (Internet of Things) and ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) to automatically and intelligently water crops, addressing aging populations and labour shortages in Tasmania's rural areas. It uses sensors, control panels, and control systems to develop and implement innovative watering methods.</p>
<p>
Using the Internet, Watering and fertilizing can be performed remotely, so there is no need to attend physically. </p>
<p>As a result of remote watering, transportation costs are reduced.</p>
<p>Water can be managed precisely on farms, thus achieving sustainable development and economizing water.
Sufficient and nutritious food supply with low labour cost.</p>
